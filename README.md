# NashDev Twitter Bot

## Overview
Currently the NashDev slack channel's events calendar which is tied integrated with Twitter is posted manually. This is impressive but seems quite unsustainable. Thus an automated solution should be built in order to replace the current method.

## Questions

* Is the Twitter integration with Slack the current solution?
* How are events currently sourced?
* Where from?
* Is there a single place that contains all events?

## ToDo
* [X] Get a Github Repo
* [X] Write a readme
* [ ] Answer Questions
* [ ] Scope work
* [ ] Add scoped work to ToDo
* [ ] Write docs
* [ ] Write tests
* [ ] Implement
